** Big Warning - Don't Do this!
---------------------------------------------
Suppose we had 20 modification and steps in this project?
We would create 20 different eclipse projects? Of course not! We will use GIT! 

What does GIT mean, what is its acronym? It's a currious story I understand so well!

Linus Torvalds developed Linux and he called it "GIT". What's in a name?
I don't know in what period of time it was, but at some point in the 70s, 
it was and english slang for "a stupid person‚Äù. "Stupid Person!"

Well here is some definition I have in common with "Linus Torvalds". He said:
"I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself." Git!

There you have, we will from now on use the - STUPID GIT! Which is not so stupid!
Remember me!
