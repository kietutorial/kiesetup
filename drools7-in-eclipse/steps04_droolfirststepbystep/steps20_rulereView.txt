Review Rule and DRL File
----------------------------------------
We created a rule: fancyhello.drl. What does it all mean.

//packages
package com.droolsexample.basicproject

//list any import classes here.
import com.droolsexample.basicproject.FancyHello;

//declare any global variables here

rule "Your First Rule"
    when
		FancyHello()
    then
		System.out.println("We have a fancy hello");
end


1. Package definition
All rules should be defined withing a package, similar to a java package
Ex: package com.droolsexample.basicproject

2. Package and oject imports
Like a java class, we can import data, data model, services or object needed to run the rule.
Ex: import com.droolsexample.basicproject.FancyHello;

3. Create object, variables here in the rule, instead of importing them
//declare any global variables here

4. All rules must have name: "Your First Rule"
rule "Your First Rule"

5. The Left Hand Side (LHS), the rule conditions. Condition for RETE algorithm.
   The rules engine, matches the LHS definition. 
when
	FancyHello()

Ex: 
	After the when, we define the FancyHello() object with no constraints.
	Which simply states the FancyHello fact exist as an inserted fact.
   	Remember, we inserted this fact before firing the session:
		FancyHello hello = new FancyHello();
		sessionStatefull.insert(hello);

6. The Right Hand Side (RHS), the rule actions. Triggered when rule condition is matched.
then
	System.out.println("We have a fancy hello");

Ex:
	This rule action simply outputs a message.

7. We have to end the rule definition
end

For now these are the basics of a rule definition.
